        <h2>AES Belgium Students</h2>

        <div class="full-wide" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 20px; padding: 15px 0px 0px; float: left; width: 685px; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px;">In 2015 a group of students from PXL-Music started 'AES Belgium - Studentsâ€™, with co-operation from their faculty and AES Belgium.

        <p>AES is the single most important international organization that unites audio engineers, creative artists, scientists and students worldwide.<br>&nbsp;<br>AES Belgium - Students attempt to provide a platform for current Belgian students to expand their network within the audio engineering sector.</p>

        <p>We organise company visits, workshops, masterclasses, equipment demos, visits to audio engineering related events and, of&nbsp;course, meetings. <br>Through these events we attempt to complement and bridge the gap between the numourous Belgian audio educational programmes.<br>Students get a first-hand experience of some of the inner workings of the sector and meet skilled professionals along the way.</p>

        <p>We therefore welcome any student of any faculty with an interest in audio engineering to join in on an event. <br>Membership is completely free and without any&nbsp;obligations, though students are encouraged to contribute and involve themselves within the organisation.</p>
